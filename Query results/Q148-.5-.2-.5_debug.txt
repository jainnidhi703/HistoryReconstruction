[0.326478] : Sony Pictures , a unit of Sony Corp , bought the Grouper online video site last August for $ 65 million and is now renaming it Crackle in an effort to reposition the site as a streaming entertainment network with channels on animation , horror and other genres
[0.318419] : The new Yahoo home page features a tab on the left hand column of the page with sophisticated links to the user 's 10 or 20 favorite sites
[0.318379] : Crackle videos will also be available for sharing on social networking sites like News Corp 's MySpace , Facebook and Friendster , and Sony devices such as the Sony PSP portable gaming device and Sony Vaio laptop computer
[0.310113] : The makeover of Yahoo.com marks the company 's 14-year evolution from the Web 's pioneering directory of sites to an index of links to a search navigation tool to a complex media destination site
[0.302112] : A spokeswoman said Yahoo planned to invite a random sample of its users amounting to less than 1 percent of audience
[0.295663] : It functions as an alternative to navigation methods like bookmarks , link bars or browser tabs , he said
[0.290192] : Separately , in a bid to shore up morale within a company that has been besieged by competition , a tough advertising market and the so far unwonted takeover gestures of Microsoft , Yahoo has introduced a campaign to encourage employees to dress in purple -- the company 's primary color -- at work
[0.288833] : The Yahoo home page attracts around 100 million U.S. users a month and 300 million worldwide , Bhat said

[0.276869] : Sony Pictures said it would help back the best ideas on Crackle to turn them into potential television shows or movies
[0.275813] : But Dangson said the collective judgment of IDC researchers is that Yahoo has made a series of very exciting announcements over the past year , but has been slow to deliver on any of its promises to open up and transform how its sites function

[0.27389] : The new home page relies on slick personalization technology that allows users who have signed into their Yahoo account to see when new information arrives not just on Yahoo sites , like e-mail or news , but off-Yahoo on sites such as eBay Inc auctions or Google Inc 's Gmail service

[0.254989] : Some of those makeovers have frustrated users who prefer `` classic '' versions of their favorite sites , she said , adding to the caution of Yahoo , which attracts some of the biggest audiences on the Web to Yahoo.com , Yahoo News and Yahoo Mail
[0.249174] : Two years ago , the last such redesign of Yahoo.com took up to six months to fully implement , the Yahoo executive said
